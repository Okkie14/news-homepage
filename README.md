- SVG
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Created my very first svg in this project and I'm very proud of my accomplishment. 

```html
<svg class="hamburger-bar" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="25">
        <rect class="line top"
            width="80" height="10"
            x="10" y="20" rx="5">
        </rect>
        <rect class="line middle"
            width="80" height="10"
            x="10" y="45" rx="5">
        </rect>
        <rect class="line bottom"
            width="80" height="10"
            x="10" y="70" rx="5">
        </rect>
      </svg>
```

### Continued development

Building out the hamburger menu was interesting and challenging future development in this section is required to get it working more smoothly.
